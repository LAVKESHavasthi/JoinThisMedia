    <h2>Early Life and Birth</h2>  
    <p>  
        Lord Krishna, the eighth incarnation of Lord Vishnu, is one of the most revered and beloved deities in Hinduism. His birth is celebrated as Janmashtami, a festival marking the descent of divinity into the mortal realm.  
    </p>  
    <p>  
        Krishna was born to Devaki and Vasudeva in the prison of Mathura, where his tyrannical uncle, King Kansa, had imprisoned them due to a prophecy that Devaki’s eighth child would kill him.  
        On the night of his birth, divine intervention allowed Vasudeva to secretly carry baby Krishna across the Yamuna River to Gokul, where he was raised by foster parents, Nanda and Yashoda.  
    </p>  
    <p>  
        As a child, Krishna’s mischievous nature, fondness for butter, and divine playfulness enchanted everyone in Gokul. His miracles, such as subduing the serpent Kaliya and lifting the Govardhan Hill, hinted at his divine identity.
