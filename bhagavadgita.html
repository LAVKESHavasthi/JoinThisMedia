            <p><b>The Bhagavad Gita</b>, often referred to as the *Gita*, is a 700-verse scripture that is part of the Indian epic *Mahabharata*. It is a sacred text of the Hindu religion and is considered a spiritual and philosophical guide, addressing fundamental questions about life, duty, and the pursuit of knowledge.</p>

            <h3>Origin and Context</h3>
            <p>The Bhagavad Gita is set within the narrative of the *Mahabharata*. It takes place on the battlefield of Kurukshetra, where the Pandavas and Kauravas are poised for war. The Gita is a dialogue between Prince Arjuna and Lord Krishna, who serves as his charioteer and divine guide. As Arjuna faces a moral dilemma about fighting in the war, Krishna imparts profound teachings on duty, morality, and spirituality.</p>

            <h3>Structure of the Gita</h3>
            <p>The Bhagavad Gita is divided into 18 chapters, each dealing with a specific aspect of life and spiritual practice. These chapters are categorized into three main sections:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Karma Yoga:</b> The path of selfless action.</li>
                <li><b>Bhakti Yoga:</b> The path of devotion and surrender to the divine.</li>
                <li><b>Jnana Yoga:</b> The path of knowledge and wisdom.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Key Themes and Teachings</h3>
            <h4>Dharma (Duty)</h4>
            <p>Krishna emphasizes the importance of performing one's duty (dharma) without attachment to the results. He teaches Arjuna that it is better to follow one's own path imperfectly than to imitate someone else's perfectly.</p>

            <h4>Karma and Detachment</h4>
            <p>The Gita introduces the concept of *Nishkama Karma*, or action without desire for the fruits. Krishna advises Arjuna to act selflessly, dedicating all actions to the divine, and to maintain equanimity in success and failure.</p>

            <h4>Yoga and Self-Realization</h4>
            <p>The Gita presents yoga as a practical means to achieve self-realization and liberation (moksha). Krishna outlines various types of yoga, including Karma Yoga, Bhakti Yoga, and Jnana Yoga, offering a path suitable for individuals of different temperaments and inclinations.</p>

            <h4>Atman and Brahman</h4>
            <p>Krishna explains the eternal nature of the soul (*Atman*) and its oneness with the ultimate reality (*Brahman*). He teaches that the soul is immortal and beyond birth and death, unaffected by the physical body.</p>

            <h3>Arjuna’s Dilemma and Resolution</h3>
            <p>At the start of the Gita, Arjuna is paralyzed by doubt and sorrow, unwilling to fight against his own relatives and mentors. Krishna’s teachings gradually resolve his confusion, inspiring him to rise above personal attachments and fulfill his duty as a warrior.</p>

            <h3>Universal Appeal</h3>
            <p>Though rooted in Hindu philosophy, the Bhagavad Gita transcends religious boundaries and offers wisdom applicable to all aspects of life. Its teachings on ethical decision-making, personal growth, and spiritual fulfillment have inspired countless individuals worldwide.</p>

            <h3>Impact and Legacy</h3>
            <p>The Bhagavad Gita has influenced thinkers and leaders such as Mahatma Gandhi, Swami Vivekananda, Albert Einstein, and Carl Jung. It continues to serve as a source of guidance and inspiration for millions, providing insights into the nature of life, purpose, and the pursuit of inner peace.</p>

            <h3>Key Quotes from the Gita</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><i>"You have the right to perform your duties, but you are not entitled to the fruits of your actions."</i> (Chapter 2, Verse 47)</li>
                <li><i>"When a man lets go of all desires in his mind and is content with the Self alone, then he is truly at peace."</i> (Chapter 2, Verse 55)</li>
                <li><i>"Whatever you do, whatever you eat, whatever you offer, whatever you give, do it as an offering to me."</i> (Chapter 9, Verse 27)</li>
            </ul>
