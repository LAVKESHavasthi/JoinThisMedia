                <h1>Srinivasa Ramanujan</h1>
                <p>The extraordinary life and mathematical genius of Srinivasa Ramanujan, a self-taught Indian mathematician.</p>
            </section>

            <section class="intro">
                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>Srinivasa Ramanujan (1887â€“1920) was a self-taught Indian mathematician who made significant contributions to mathematical analysis, number theory, infinite series, and continued fractions. Despite his lack of formal training, Ramanujan's groundbreaking work earned him recognition as one of the greatest mathematicians in history. His story is a testament to human brilliance, creativity, and perseverance.</p>

            <section>
                <h2>1. Early Life</h2>
                <p>Ramanujan was born on December 22, 1887, in Erode, Tamil Nadu, India, to a Tamil Brahmin family. His father, K. Srinivasa Iyengar, worked as a clerk, while his mother, Komalatammal, was a homemaker and deeply religious. As a child, Ramanujan showed an exceptional aptitude for mathematics. By the age of 12, he had mastered advanced trigonometry and began exploring complex mathematical problems independently.</p>

                <h2>2. Mathematical Genius</h2>
                <p>Ramanujan's passion for mathematics consumed him, often to the detriment of his formal education. At 16, he obtained a copy of G.S. Carr's *Synopsis of Elementary Results in Pure and Applied Mathematics*, which became his mathematical foundation. The book contained thousands of theorems, but little explanation. Ramanujan independently derived many of these theorems and developed new ones, showcasing his innate genius.</p>

                <h2>3. Struggles and Breakthrough</h2>
                <p>Despite his talent, Ramanujan faced significant challenges. He struggled to secure stable employment and lacked formal recognition for his work. In 1913, he wrote to the renowned British mathematician G.H. Hardy at Cambridge University, enclosing a collection of his theorems. Hardy recognized Ramanujan's brilliance and invited him to Cambridge, marking the beginning of a historic collaboration.</p>

                <h2>4. Ramanujan at Cambridge</h2>
                <p>Ramanujan joined Hardy at Cambridge in 1914. The collaboration between Hardy and Ramanujan was immensely productive, leading to significant contributions in mathematical fields such as partition theory, modular forms, and mock theta functions. Hardy once described Ramanujan's mathematical intuition as almost supernatural, placing him in the same league as greats like Euler and Gauss.</p>

                <h2>5. Unique Contributions</h2>
                <p>Ramanujan's work includes approximately 3,900 results, many of which were groundbreaking. Some of his most famous contributions include the Ramanujan-Hardy number 1729 (the smallest number expressible as the sum of two cubes in two different ways) and his work on highly composite numbers, modular equations, and infinite series. His notebooks, known as the *Ramanujan Notebooks*, continue to be studied by mathematicians worldwide.</p>

                <h2>6. Challenges and Health Decline</h2>
                <p>Ramanujan's time in England was not without difficulties. He faced cultural and dietary challenges, and the harsh English climate affected his health. In 1917, he was diagnosed with a severe illness, later identified as tuberculosis and malnutrition. Despite these challenges, he continued to produce remarkable mathematical work.</p>

                <h2>7. Return to India and Final Years</h2>
                <p>In 1919, Ramanujan returned to India due to his declining health. Despite receiving a hero's welcome, his condition worsened. On April 26, 1920, at the age of 32, Ramanujan passed away, leaving behind a legacy that continues to inspire generations of mathematicians.</p>

                <h2>8. Legacy and Recognition</h2>
                <p>Ramanujan's contributions have had a lasting impact on mathematics. His work has been instrumental in fields such as number theory, combinatorics, and theoretical physics. In his honor, December 22 is celebrated as National Mathematics Day in India. The Ramanujan Prize, awarded annually, recognizes outstanding contributions to mathematics by young researchers in developing countries.</p>
