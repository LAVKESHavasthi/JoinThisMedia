            <p><b>Lord Ram</b> is one of the most revered deities in Hinduism and the central figure of the epic *Ramayana*. He is considered the seventh incarnation (*avatar*) of Lord Vishnu and is worshipped as the ideal king, husband, and personification of dharma (righteousness).</p>

            <h3>Birth and Early Life</h3>
            <p>Lord Ram was born in the royal family of Ayodhya to King Dasharatha and Queen Kaushalya. His birth, as narrated in the *Ramayana*, was the answer to the prayers of the gods for a savior to defeat the demon king Ravana. Ram grew up with his three brothers—Lakshman, Bharat, and Shatrughan—learning the principles of dharma and mastering the art of warfare.</p>

            <h3>Marriage to Sita</h3>
            <p>Lord Ram married Sita, the daughter of King Janaka of Mithila, after successfully lifting and stringing the divine bow of Lord Shiva during a *swayamvara* (marriage contest). Sita is regarded as an incarnation of Goddess Lakshmi and symbolizes virtue and devotion.</p>

            <h3>Exile and Forest Life</h3>
            <p>Due to a promise made by King Dasharatha to his wife Kaikeyi, Ram renounced the throne and went into exile for 14 years. Sita and his loyal brother Lakshman accompanied him. During this time, Ram encountered sages, fought demons, and upheld dharma in every situation.</p>

            <h3>Abduction of Sita and the Battle with Ravana</h3>
            <p>During their exile, Sita was abducted by Ravana, the ten-headed demon king of Lanka. With the help of Hanuman, Sugriva, and an army of monkeys, Ram built a bridge (*Ram Setu*) across the sea to reach Lanka. He fought a fierce battle with Ravana, eventually killing him and rescuing Sita, thereby restoring peace and righteousness.</p>

            <h3>Return to Ayodhya</h3>
            <p>After the completion of the exile, Ram returned to Ayodhya with Sita and Lakshman, where he was crowned king. His rule, known as *Rama Rajya*, is remembered as an era of justice, prosperity, and harmony.</p>

            <h3>Symbolism and Teachings</h3>
