        <h2>Early Life and Creation</h2>
        <p>
            Lord Ganesha, the son of Lord Shiva and Goddess Parvati, holds a central place in Hindu mythology. His creation is one of the most well-known stories in Indian lore. 
            Goddess Parvati, while preparing for a bath, created Ganesha from the clay and sandalwood paste on her body. She breathed life into him and assigned him the task of guarding her. 
        </p>
        <p>
            When Lord Shiva returned home and found Ganesha barring his entry, he became furious, as he was unaware of his wife's creation. In his rage, Shiva severed Ganesha's head. 
            Upon learning the truth from Parvati, Shiva sought to atone for his actions. He instructed his attendants to bring the head of the first creature they encountered, which happened to be an elephant. 
            Shiva affixed the elephant head onto Ganesha's body, reviving him and declaring him as the foremost deity to be worshiped at the start of any ceremony or endeavor.
