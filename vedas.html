            <p><b>The Vedas</b> are the oldest and most sacred texts of Hinduism, forming the foundation of Vedic literature and Indian philosophy. Composed in ancient Sanskrit, the Vedas are considered divinely revealed (*shruti*) and provide guidance on spiritual, moral, and societal matters.</p>

            <h3>Structure of the Vedas</h3>
            <p>The Vedas are divided into four main texts:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Rigveda:</b> The oldest Veda, consisting of hymns dedicated to various deities such as Agni, Indra, and Varuna. It focuses on cosmology, rituals, and praises.</li>
                <li><b>Samaveda:</b> Known as the "Veda of Chants," it provides melodies for the hymns of the Rigveda, used during rituals and ceremonies.</li>
                <li><b>Yajurveda:</b> A compilation of prose and verses that guide priests in performing sacrificial rituals and ceremonies.</li>
                <li><b>Atharvaveda:</b> Contains hymns, spells, and incantations addressing everyday life, including health, prosperity, and protection from harm.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Components of the Vedas</h3>
            <p>Each Veda is divided into four parts, serving different purposes:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Samhitas:</b> Collections of hymns, mantras, and prayers.</li>
                <li><b>Brahmanas:</b> Prose texts that explain rituals and ceremonies.</li>
                <li><b>Aranyakas:</b> Philosophical discussions for forest dwellers and ascetics.</li>
                <li><b>Upanishads:</b> Spiritual and philosophical treatises exploring the nature of reality, the self (*Atman*), and the ultimate truth (*Brahman*).</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Key Themes and Teachings</h3>
            <h4>Cosmology and Creation</h4>
            <p>The Rigveda contains hymns that explore the origin of the universe, such as the *Nasadiya Sukta*, which speculates about creation and the role of a supreme being.</p>

            <h4>Rituals and Sacrifices</h4>
            <p>The Vedas emphasize the importance of performing rituals (*yajnas*) to maintain cosmic order (*rita*). These sacrifices invoke the gods and ensure harmony between humans, nature, and the divine.</p>

            <h4>Philosophy and Spirituality</h4>
            <p>The Upanishads, often regarded as the culmination of Vedic thought, delve into profound questions about existence, the nature of the self, and the path to liberation (*moksha*).</p>

            <h3>Significance of the Vedas</h3>
            <p>The Vedas serve as the cornerstone of Hindu philosophy, culture, and religious practices. They outline principles of morality, social organization, and spiritual growth. Their influence extends beyond religion, shaping Indian art, music, and literature.</p>

            <h3>Preservation and Legacy</h3>
            <p>The oral tradition played a crucial role in preserving the Vedas for thousands of years. Priests and scholars memorized and recited the texts with meticulous accuracy, ensuring their continuity. The Vedas continue to inspire scholars, practitioners, and seekers worldwide.</p>

            <h3>Global Influence</h3>
            <p>The philosophical ideas in the Vedas, particularly in the Upanishads, have inspired global thinkers and spiritual leaders. Concepts like the unity of existence, the immortality of the soul, and the pursuit of truth resonate universally.</p>

            <h3>Key Quotes from the Vedas</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><i>"Truth is one; sages call it by various names."</i> (Rigveda 1.164.46)</li>
                <li><i>"Let noble thoughts come to us from every side."</i> (Rigveda 1.89.1)</li>
                <li><i>"From darkness, lead me to light; from ignorance, lead me to knowledge; from death, lead me to immortality."</i> (Brihadaranyaka Upanishad 1.3.28)</li>
            </ul>
