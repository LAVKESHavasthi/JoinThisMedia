            <p><b>Subhas Chandra Bose</b> was an Indian nationalist and freedom fighter who played a prominent role in the struggle for India's independence from British colonial rule. He is best known for his leadership in the Indian National Army (INA) and his controversial alliance with Axis powers during World War II in the fight against British rule.</p>

            <h3>Early Life and Education</h3>
            <p>Subhas Chandra Bose was born on January 23, 1897, in Cuttack, Orissa (now Odisha), into a prominent Bengali family. He excelled in his studies and went on to study at the University of Calcutta, where he earned a degree in philosophy. He later went to Cambridge University in England to pursue further studies, where he was deeply influenced by nationalist ideas.</p>

            <h3>Entry into Politics</h3>
            <p>Bose's political journey began with his involvement in the Indian National Congress (INC). He quickly rose through the ranks, known for his radical views and desire for complete independence from British rule. Unlike Mahatma Gandhi's philosophy of non-violence, Bose advocated for more direct action, including the use of force, to achieve independence.</p>

            <h3>Indian National Congress and Leadership</h3>
            <p>Subhas Chandra Bose was elected the President of the Indian National Congress in 1938. His leadership was marked by his opposition to the policies of the Congress's moderate leadership, particularly Mahatma Gandhi. He pushed for a more militant approach to fighting British colonialism. His radical views often put him at odds with Gandhi and other Congress leaders, leading to his resignation as the President of the Congress in 1939.</p>

            <h3>The Indian National Army</h3>
            <p>In 1941, Bose escaped house arrest in India and traveled to Germany, where he sought support from the Axis powers in his fight against Britain. He later moved to Japan and took command of the Indian National Army (INA), an army composed of Indian prisoners of war and expatriates, which aimed to fight British forces in India. Under his leadership, the INA played a significant role in Japan's campaign in Southeast Asia, although it was ultimately defeated in 1945.</p>

            <h3>Alliance with Axis Powers</h3>
            <p>Bose's alliance with Nazi Germany and Imperial Japan during World War II remains a subject of controversy. He believed that Axis powers could help India gain independence from British rule, even though the cooperation came with the cost of aligning with regimes that were responsible for atrocities in Europe and Asia. Despite this, Bose remained committed to his goal of Indian independence, famously declaring, "Give me blood, and I will give you freedom."</p>

            <h3>Legacy and Impact</h3>
            <p>Subhas Chandra Bose's legacy is marked by his commitment to Indian independence and his uncompromising stance against British rule. His leadership of the INA and his fiery speeches continue to inspire millions of Indians today. Though his alliance with the Axis powers remains controversial, his role in the independence movement cannot be understated. He is remembered as a national hero, and his contributions to India's struggle for freedom are commemorated every year on his birthday, January 23, as Parakram Divas (Day of Courage).</p>
