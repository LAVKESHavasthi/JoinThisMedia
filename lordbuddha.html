                <h1>Lord Buddha</h1>
                <p>Lord Buddha, also known as Siddhartha Gautama, was a spiritual leader and the founder of Buddhism. His teachings of enlightenment, compassion, and the Middle Path continue to inspire millions worldwide.</p>
            </section>

            <section class="intro">
                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>Born in the 5th or 6th century BCE in Lumbini (modern-day Nepal), Siddhartha Gautama renounced his royal life to seek the ultimate truth. After attaining enlightenment under the Bodhi tree, he became the Buddha, meaning "The Awakened One." His philosophy and way of life formed the foundation of Buddhism, a major world religion and spiritual practice.</p>

                <h2>1. Early Life of Siddhartha Gautama</h2>
                <p>Lord Buddha was born into the Shakya clan as the prince of Kapilavastu. His father, King Suddhodana, and mother, Queen Maya, sought to shield him from the harsh realities of life. Despite this, Siddhartha encountered the "Four Sights"—an old man, a sick man, a dead body, and a wandering ascetic—which profoundly affected him and awakened a desire to seek the meaning of life and suffering.</p>
                <p>At the age of 29, Siddhartha left his palace, family, and royal duties to begin his spiritual quest, marking the start of his journey toward enlightenment.</p>

                <h2>2. The Search for Enlightenment</h2>
                <p>Siddhartha Gautama practiced extreme asceticism for six years, hoping to achieve spiritual awakening. However, he realized that self-mortification was not the path to liberation. This realization led him to the Middle Path—a balanced approach between indulgence and austerity.</p>
                <p>Under the Bodhi tree in Bodh Gaya, India, Siddhartha meditated deeply and overcame the temptations of Mara, the demon of illusion. On the full moon night, he attained enlightenment and became the Buddha.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>The Four Noble Truths:</strong> These outline the nature of suffering, its causes, its cessation, and the path leading to liberation.</li>
                    <li><strong>The Noble Eightfold Path:</strong> A practical guide to ethical living, mental discipline, and wisdom.</li>
                    <li><strong>The Three Universal Truths:</strong> Impermanence, suffering, and the concept of no-self.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Buddha emphasized mindfulness, compassion, and non-attachment as essential elements for achieving inner peace and enlightenment.</p>
