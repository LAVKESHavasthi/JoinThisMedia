            <p><b>The Mahabharata</b> is one of the two major Sanskrit epics of ancient India, the other being the *Ramayana*. It is attributed to the sage Vyasa and is considered the longest epic poem ever written, consisting of over 100,000 shlokas (verses). The Mahabharata is not just a story but a comprehensive guide to life, incorporating philosophy, ethics, politics, and spirituality.</p>
            
            <h3>Origin and Structure</h3>
            <p>The Mahabharata was composed over several centuries, beginning around 400 BCE and completed around 400 CE. It is divided into 18 books, or *Parvas*, each dealing with various aspects of the narrative and teachings. The epic explores the moral struggles of humanity through the tale of the Kuru dynasty.</p>

            <h3>Plot Overview</h3>
            <p>The Mahabharata narrates the story of the Kuru dynasty, focusing on the rivalry between the Pandavas (sons of Pandu) and the Kauravas (sons of Dhritarashtra). The conflict culminates in the Kurukshetra War, a massive battle fought over the throne of Hastinapur.</p>
            
            <h4>The Pandavas and Kauravas</h4>
            <p>The Pandavas are exiled after being deceived in a game of dice orchestrated by Duryodhana. During their exile, they prepare for the eventual war and strengthen alliances. The Bhagavad Gita, a philosophical discourse, is delivered by Krishna to Arjuna on the battlefield when Arjuna hesitates to fight against his relatives and mentors.</p>

            <h4>The Kurukshetra War</h4>
            <p>The war lasts 18 days and witnesses immense destruction. Heroes like Bhishma, Drona, Karna, and Abhimanyu meet their tragic ends. Ultimately, the Pandavas emerge victorious, but the cost of the war leaves them disillusioned.</p>

            <h4>After the War</h4>
            <p>Yudhishthira is crowned king, but the Pandavas renounce the throne and embark on their final journey to the Himalayas. The epic concludes with Yudhishthira reaching heaven and discovering the ultimate truths of life and dharma.</p>

            <h3>The Bhagavad Gita</h3>
            <p>Embedded within the Mahabharata is the Bhagavad Gita, a spiritual and philosophical dialogue between Krishna and Arjuna. It addresses the nature of duty, the self, and the path to liberation, and remains one of the most revered texts in Hindu philosophy.</p>

            <h3>Symbolism and Teachings</h3>
            <p>The Mahabharata encapsulates the complexities of human life, addressing themes like duty, loyalty, betrayal, ambition, and the moral dilemmas faced in life. It teaches that dharma is not absolute but contextual, requiring discernment and wisdom.</p>

            <h3>Legacy and Influence</h3>
            <p>The Mahabharata has had a profound impact on Indian culture and beyond. It has inspired countless adaptations in literature, theater, film, and television. Its lessons on leadership, morality, and spirituality continue to resonate globally.</p>
