            <p><b>Mahatma Gandhi</b> was a prominent leader in the Indian independence movement and one of the most influential figures in modern world history. Known for his philosophy of nonviolence (ahimsa) and civil disobedience, Gandhi played a key role in leading India to independence from British colonial rule. His principles of truth, nonviolence, and self-reliance continue to inspire movements for peace and justice worldwide.</p>

            <h3>Early Life and Education</h3>
            <p>Mahatma Gandhi was born on October 2, 1869, in Porbandar, Gujarat, into a Hindu merchant family. Gandhi was deeply influenced by his family’s values, including truthfulness and a sense of duty. He went to London to study law at University College London and was called to the bar in 1891. Upon his return to India, he initially struggled to establish his legal career but soon became involved in social activism.</p>

            <h3>South Africa and the Formation of His Philosophy</h3>
            <p>In 1893, Gandhi went to South Africa to work as a lawyer and it was here that he first encountered the institutionalized racism faced by Indians and other non-white communities. This experience led him to develop his philosophy of nonviolent resistance. Gandhi organized protests against discriminatory laws and became a key figure in the fight for civil rights for Indians in South Africa. It was during this time that he coined the term "satyagraha," meaning "truth force," which would later become central to his leadership in India.</p>

            <h3>Return to India and the Struggle for Independence</h3>
            <p>Gandhi returned to India in 1915 and quickly became a leading figure in the Indian independence movement. He advocated for a nonviolent struggle against British colonial rule and called for mass civil disobedience. His leadership in campaigns like the Non-Cooperation Movement (1920-1922), the Salt March (1930), and the Quit India Movement (1942) were pivotal in mobilizing the Indian masses against British rule.</p>

            <h3>Salt March and Civil Disobedience</h3>
            <p>One of Gandhi's most famous acts of resistance was the Salt March in 1930, a 240-mile march to the Arabian Sea to protest the British monopoly on salt production and sales. This act of civil disobedience inspired millions of Indians to join the movement and defy British laws peacefully. The Salt March became a turning point in the struggle for independence, highlighting the power of nonviolent resistance.</p>

            <h3>Philosophy of Nonviolence (Ahimsa) and Truth (Satya)</h3>
            <p>Gandhi's belief in nonviolence, or "ahimsa," was at the core of his political and social philosophy. He believed that nonviolence was not just a political tool, but a way of life that should govern every aspect of human behavior. Along with nonviolence, Gandhi stressed the importance of "satya" (truth), believing that truth is the highest virtue and must guide one’s actions. His methods of protest were centered around nonviolent civil disobedience, aimed at exposing the moral injustice of British rule.</p>

            <h3>Independence and Partition</h3>
            <p>After years of struggle, India gained independence from British rule on August 15, 1947. However, the partition of India into two nations, India and Pakistan, led to widespread violence and communal unrest. Gandhi, who had worked tirelessly for Hindu-Muslim unity, was deeply troubled by the bloodshed during partition. He undertook several fasts and efforts to promote peace, but the violence continued to escalate.</p>

            <h3>Assassination and Legacy</h3>
            <p>Mahatma Gandhi was assassinated on January 30, 1948, by Nathuram Godse, a Hindu nationalist who opposed Gandhi's philosophy of tolerance and nonviolence. Gandhi's death marked the end of an era, but his legacy continues to influence global movements for civil rights, justice, and peace. Leaders like Martin Luther King Jr., Nelson Mandela, and César Chávez have cited Gandhi as a major influence on their own struggles for justice.</p>

            <h3>Principles of Gandhian Philosophy</h3>
            <p>Gandhi's ideas continue to be a guiding light in the pursuit of peace, justice, and equality. Some key principles of Gandhian philosophy include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Nonviolence (Ahimsa):</b> Gandhi believed in the power of nonviolent resistance, even in the face of extreme oppression and violence.</li>
                <li><b>Truth (Satya):</b> For Gandhi, truth was the ultimate goal and the foundation of all his actions.</li>
                <li><b>Self-reliance (Swadeshi):</b> Gandhi promoted the idea of economic self-sufficiency for India, encouraging the use of khadi (handspun cloth) and boycotting British goods.</li>
                <li><b>Satyagraha:</b> Gandhi's philosophy of satyagraha emphasized nonviolent resistance to injustice and oppression.</li>
            </ul>
