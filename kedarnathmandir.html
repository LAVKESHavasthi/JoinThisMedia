                <h2>1. Historical Significance</h2>
                <p>The Kedarnath Mandir is believed to have been originally built by the Pandavas from the Mahabharata, who sought Lord Shiva's blessings to atone for their sins. Adi Shankaracharya, the 8th-century Indian philosopher and theologian, is credited with reviving the temple and establishing its prominence in Hindu religious practices.</p>
                <p>Archaeological evidence suggests that the temple dates back over a thousand years, making it one of the oldest Hindu temples still in use today. Its ancient construction, despite being in a region prone to extreme weather, showcases remarkable architectural ingenuity.</p>

                <p>Kedarnath is one of the 12 Jyotirlingas, which are considered the most sacred shrines of Lord Shiva. According to Hindu mythology, the temple is associated with the Pandavas, who built it to seek forgiveness for killing their kin during the Kurukshetra war. Shiva, initially evading them, took the form of a bull and disappeared into the ground at Kedarnath, leaving behind his hump, which is worshipped today.</p>
                <p>The temple is also part of the Panch Kedar pilgrimage, which includes four other shrines dedicated to Shiva: Tungnath, Rudranath, Madhyamaheshwar, and Kalpeshwar.</p>
