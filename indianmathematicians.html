            <p><b>Indian Mathematicians</b> have made significant contributions to the field of mathematics, both in ancient times and in the modern era. From the concept of zero to advancements in algebra, geometry, and calculus, India has been at the forefront of mathematical discovery. Here are some of the most prominent Indian mathematicians who have left a lasting impact on the world.</p>

            <h3>Ancient Indian Mathematicians</h3>
            <p>India’s mathematical history dates back thousands of years. Ancient Indian mathematicians contributed to the foundation of mathematics in areas such as arithmetic, algebra, and geometry. Notable figures include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Aryabhata (476–550 CE):</b> Aryabhata was one of the first major mathematicians and astronomers in ancient India. He is known for his work on the approximation of pi, the value of sine in trigonometry, and the concept of zero.</li>
                <li><b>Brahmagupta (598–668 CE):</b> Brahmagupta was a renowned mathematician and astronomer who formulated rules for the calculation of zero, negative numbers, and quadratic equations. His work on cyclic quadrilaterals and Brahmagupta’s theorem laid the groundwork for later developments in algebra.</li>
                <li><b>Bhaskara I (600–680 CE):</b> A notable mathematician and astronomer, Bhaskara I wrote significant works on algebra and arithmetic, and contributed to the study of trigonometric functions.</li>
                <li><b>Bhaskara II (1114–1185 CE):</b> Known as "Bhaskaracharya," he made contributions to differential calculus and algebra, and is credited with solving problems related to the motion of celestial bodies. His famous work "Lilavati" is still studied for its geometric and arithmetic problems.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Medieval and Modern Indian Mathematicians</h3>
            <p>While the Indian subcontinent experienced periods of foreign invasions and disruptions, mathematicians continued to make significant strides in various fields. In the modern era, Indian mathematicians like Srinivasa Ramanujan have captured the world’s attention:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Srinivasa Ramanujan (1887–1920):</b> Ramanujan was a self-taught mathematician whose work on number theory, infinite series, and continued fractions revolutionized mathematics. Despite his limited formal training, Ramanujan’s discoveries, particularly his work on partition functions, remain influential today.</li>
                <li><b>Raghunath Rao (1700–1770):</b> Known for his work in calculus and algebra, Raghunath Rao made significant contributions to Indian mathematics during the 18th century, especially in the realm of continued fractions.</li>
                <li><b>Harsha's Mathematical Contributions (10th century):</b> Harsha contributed to the understanding of geometry and trigonometry. He made important observations regarding the relationship between different geometric shapes and was one of the first to establish the properties of triangles and quadrilaterals.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Notable Contributions to Mathematics</h3>
            <p>Indian mathematicians are credited with several key contributions that shaped the development of mathematics as we know it today:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>The Concept of Zero:</b> The concept of zero as both a numeral and a placeholder was developed by Indian mathematicians, most notably by Brahmagupta in the 7th century. This innovation revolutionized mathematics and has become the foundation of modern arithmetic.</li>
                <li><b>Decimal System:</b> The Indian numeral system, based on place value and the decimal system, was developed long before it spread to other parts of the world. This system was crucial for the development of algebra and calculus.</li>
                <li><b>Algebra:</b> Indian mathematicians, especially Brahmagupta and Bhaskara, laid the foundations of algebra. They introduced methods for solving quadratic equations and working with negative numbers and irrational numbers.</li>
                <li><b>Trigonometry:</b> Aryabhata is credited with early developments in trigonometry, including defining the sine and cosine functions and making approximations for trigonometric calculations.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Influence on the World</h3>
            <p>The contributions of Indian mathematicians had a far-reaching impact on the world. Many of their works influenced mathematicians from the Islamic Golden Age, and subsequently, European scholars during the Renaissance. The spread of Indian mathematical ideas played a key role in the development of modern mathematics, particularly in fields like algebra, calculus, and number theory.</p>

            <h3>Mathematical Institutions in India</h3>
            <p>India is home to several prestigious institutions that continue to foster mathematical research and education. These include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>The Indian Statistical Institute (ISI), Kolkata:</b> A leading research institute in statistics and mathematics.</li>
                <li><b>The Tata Institute of Fundamental Research (TIFR), Mumbai:</b> Known for its research in pure and applied mathematics, as well as in physics and other fields.</li>
                <li><b>The Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Network:</b> Recognized globally for its contributions to science, engineering, and mathematics education and research.</li>
            </ul>
