            <p><b>The Ramayana</b> is one of the two major Sanskrit epics of ancient Indian literature, the other being the *Mahabharata*. Attributed to the sage Valmiki, it is a revered text in Hindu tradition, narrating the life and journey of Lord Rama, an incarnation of Lord Vishnu, and his mission to rescue his wife, Sita, from the demon king Ravana.</p>
            
            <h3>Origin and Composition</h3>
            <p>The Ramayana, believed to have been written thousands of years ago, consists of approximately 24,000 verses organized into seven sections, or *Kandas*: Bala Kanda, Ayodhya Kanda, Aranya Kanda, Kishkindha Kanda, Sundara Kanda, Yuddha Kanda, and Uttara Kanda. It is written in Sanskrit and celebrates the ideals of dharma (righteousness), loyalty, and devotion.</p>

            <h3>Main Characters</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Rama</b>: The protagonist of the epic, a prince of Ayodhya and an avatar of Vishnu.</li>
                <li><b>Sita</b>: Rama's devoted wife and an avatar of Goddess Lakshmi.</li>
                <li><b>Lakshmana</b>: Ramaâ€™s loyal brother, who accompanies him on his exile.</li>
                <li><b>Ravana</b>: The ten-headed demon king of Lanka who abducts Sita.</li>
                <li><b>Hanuman</b>: The monkey god and a devotee of Rama who plays a crucial role in the rescue of Sita.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Summary of the Story</h3>
            <p>The Ramayana begins with Rama's birth in the royal family of Ayodhya. He grows up to be a virtuous and skilled warrior and marries Sita. However, political intrigue forces Rama to renounce the throne and live in exile for 14 years. Sita and his brother Lakshmana accompany him into the forest.</p>
            <p>During their exile, Sita is abducted by Ravana and taken to his kingdom in Lanka. With the help of an army of monkeys led by Hanuman and their leader Sugriva, Rama builds a bridge to Lanka, defeats Ravana in a great battle, and rescues Sita.</p>
            <p>After returning to Ayodhya, Rama becomes king. However, doubts about Sita's chastity lead her to leave the palace and live in the forest, where she gives birth to Rama's twin sons, Lava and Kusha. Eventually, Sita returns to the Earth, and Rama reigns as a just king until he ascends to the heavens.</p>

            <h3>Symbolism and Lessons</h3>
            <p>The Ramayana is more than a story; it is a guide to life, teaching values like duty, sacrifice, respect for elders, and love for family. Each character represents virtues or vices, making the epic a timeless moral compass.</p>

            <h3>Global Influence</h3>
            <p>The Ramayana has influenced cultures far beyond India, inspiring literature, theater, and art in Southeast Asia. Its themes of good versus evil and the triumph of righteousness are universal and resonate across cultures.</p>
